of64 - openframeworks for 64 bit mac
====================================

Here is a version of oF 007 with all the i386 dependencies removed, and some of the static libraries
recompiled for 64 bit. No FMOD, no Cairo, no Quicktime.

There is a very crude example of a (Lion compatible) screensaver in there too.
